# Posting
## Tripcodes
To use a tripcode, add a # in your name. After the #, add the password
for the tripcode.  
The tripcode will aplly a hash to the password and display the hashed
password instead (what's called the tripcode).  
To use a secure tripcode, add ## instead. A secure tripcode will generate a
random text that will only be displayed if your password matches.

## Role signatures
If you wish to display your global or board role when posting, you put #rs
in your name, like a tripcode, case insensitive. This will prevent you from
using a tripcode.  
You can also chose to always display your role signature by going into your
account settings.

## Formatting
### Greentext
If you add a `>` at the start of a line, for some reason the text will be
green until the end of the line.  

<span class="greenText">mfw</span>

### Post quote
If you write `>>` and then the ID number of a post made in the same board,
it will create a link to this post.  

<a href="#" class="quoteLink">>>713705</a>

### Board link
If you write `>>>` and then add a board's URI between slashes, it will create
a link to that board.  

<a href="#" class="quoteLink">>>>/furry/</a>

### Cross-board quote

It's also possible to quote posts from other boards. Just append a post ID
number to a board link.  

<a href="#" class="quoteLink">>>>/furry/1</a>

### Spoiler
Surround your text with `[spoiler]` and `[/spoiler]` tags to hide your text
until it is hovered over. You can't break lines between the two tags.  

<span class="spoiler">nobody loves you</span>

### Urls
Urls beginning with `http` or `https` will automatically be converted to
links.
